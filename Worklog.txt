10/10/2012:
- Added basic single scattering integrator using direct light sampling.
- Added a XORShift based random number generator.
- Still working on getting a correct implementation of single scattering, rendering a Cornell box with a homogeneous medium is quite challenging.

14/10/2012:
- Added emission.

17/11/2012
- Reimplemented single scattering, it is slow and the result is not yet satisfying...
