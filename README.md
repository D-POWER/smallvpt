========

<b>smallvpt</b> (small volumetric path tracer) is an extension of <a href="http://www.kevinbeason.com/smallpt/">smallpt</a>, which is a tiny path tracer written by Kevin Beason in less than 100 lines of code.

It currently includes basic volumetric light transport using single scattering and homogeneous media. On the future, 
I plan to add full support of the Radiative Transfer Equation

Here is a render of a Cornell Box filled with homogeneous medium:
